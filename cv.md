## **About me**

Hi, I am a student at State University of Management (Moscow, Russia).\

That's how I decided to try myself in _frontend development_.

## **Hard skills**

- Visual Studio Code
- Git, GitHub
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript

## **Code examples**

```
function sayHi(yourName) {
  return `Hello, my dear friend ${yourName}`;
}

alert(sayHi('Artem'));
```
